## What it does
This app can provide our customers with information regarding the nearest MPN clinic and/or urgent care, as well as provide the option to have phone numbers and directions of the clinic.
For example, a policyholder could ask the digital assistant something like, “Find me a clinic?” and the assistant would direct them to their pre-set clinic or, if no clinic has yet been set, suggest 2-3 clinics nearby and provide the option have contact info and directions. The assistant would first direct users to request emergency care from 911 before discussing routine options.
This would give customers 24/7 access to MPN medical provider information, enhancing the customer experience.
